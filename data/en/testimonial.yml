        We as a parent are so glad that we put our ward Myra into summer camp under the leadership of Ms. Niharika. Our daughter had not only learnt new things but her confidence level has also drastically shoot up. Thanks to the faculty members who put their hard work to shape the future of budding children. We surely recommend Fitness Vibe for all what they have done. All the best to them for their future assignments.
